In this SQL, I querried a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and other specific data.

/*How many orders were placed in January?*/
SELECT COUNT(orderId)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

/*How many of these orders were for an iPhone?*/
SELECT COUNT(orderId)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone';

/*Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.*/
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderid;

/*Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?*/

SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price
Asc 
LIMIT 1;

/*What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?*/
SELECT orderid, quantity, price, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

SELECT SUM(quantity), price, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price;

SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

/*Which products were sold in Februaary at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold and what was the total revenue?*/
SELECT 
SUM(quantity), product, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

/*How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?*/
SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
JOIN BIT_DB.Customers Cust
ON Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
