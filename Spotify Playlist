--In this SQL project, I downloaded a spotify data from Kaggle and created a table afterwards to accomodate the downloaded Spotify data for further queries.

--To create the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

--Next, I insterted the downloaded Spotify Data(.csv) into the table.

--Here, I ran a select query to show the entire table and its contents to know the specific information I would like to draw from the data.
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--Here, I was interested in knowing the songs with a time signature of exactly 3 alongside the name of the artist.
SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE time_signature =3;

--Here, I ran a query to show the number of songs owned by Bad Bunny on the playlist.
SELECT artist_name as Artist, COUNT(track_name) as 'No. of tracks'
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Bad Bunny';

--Here, I ran a query to show the Top 5 most popular songs.
SELECT artist_name as Artist, track_name as 'Song Title', Popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 5;

--Here, I calculated the average popularity for the artists in the table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, I showed their name, average popularity, and labeled them as a “Top Star”
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
 
SELECT  artist_name,
        average_popularity,
        'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
